Ive been writing C# for about 2 years now mostly for uni projects, I've made a lot of smaller ones focusing on implementing algorithms
or data structures but i dont feel theyre worth showing off or especially interesting. The logical interpretator is my 2nd year coursework and
let me pass my Data Structures and Algorithms class withotu having to do a final exam.
