During the summer i decided to give c and c++ a try aswell, i made a couple of smaller-ish projects in C which 
i dont feel are worth showing off and decided to try to make a version of the card game yu-gi-oh in c++. Honestly
there is still so much i need to fix and improve with it and its very very far from finished or polished(and fix my horrible memory management) but I feel
like it let me atleast somewhat get a grasp of making bigger projects in c++.
